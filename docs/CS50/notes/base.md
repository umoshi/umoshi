The radix (plural radices) or base is the number of unique digits including zero. 

This can be represented by powers. In [[Unary]] you'd have something like 
$$
x = 1^0
$$
In this case x = 1,  an example with more [[Unary]] digits



base-1 is 0, hence [[Unary]]
base-2 is 0-1, hence [[Binary]] 
base-10 would be 0-9, hence [[Decimal]]
