Computer science is the study of computers, it contains everything relating to the inner workings of them.

Usually structured from bottom to top in layers, from high-end languages like [[GDScript]] — having more human-readability at the cost of obfuscating more the actual process being executed by the machine in the literal sense —, to the lowest of lows like [[Binary]], or something like [[C]].

It is mostly defined by a simple diagram:

You have a problem / "Input" — which via a function/process — you solve, giving you a solution / "Output".

The hard part is ***how*** you solve the problem.

Computers are very fond of powers of 2, so you will see systems like [[Binary]] all around, as well as its respective units : [[bit]] & [[byte]].

The reason [[Binary]] is used in comparison to the active physical application of voltages is because it is really easy to do extremes with computers, as well as with more and more data being thrown, it gets harder to be exact when managing the values when editing them.
